<h2>Artifact #1</h2>
	
	
	
	<img src="Artifacts/Photo 1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="sneaker"/>

	
	
	
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>Being able to showcase my creativity made this one of my favorite items. I got to customize a pair of sneakers. I experimented with colors until I discovered the ideal ones. I used a few different tones of purple and yellow. I desired it to resemble an athletic shoe. It applies to all sports and could have been for any one of them.</p>
	<br>
	
<h2>Artifact #2</h2>
	
	
<img src="Artifacts/Photo 2.png" width="400" height="300" alt="People"/>
	
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>This project was created completely from scratch by me. I took an index card and made a plan for what I was going to do. After that, I opened Adobe Illustrator and began working there. I wanted to write a touching narrative. The cloud and lighting suggest a dark and dreary day, while the skateboarder is hurtling to his demise. The shattered heart signifies the person on the skate's impending demise. I included a figure and some objects there. I mostly utilized the pen tool and, I believe, the gradient tool.</p>
	
	<br>
	
<h2>Artifact #3</h2>
	
<img src="Artifacts/Photo 3.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""/>
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>My gradient-portrait was chosen. That is my favorite portrait. Because it's a photo of my best friend Michael and myself, I chose that photo to transform into art. Every day, he brings delight to my heart, and our friendship can be conveyed through this work. Even though I only met him this year, it feels like we've known each other for a long time. I took a lot of steps to make this, but I got it done. I snapped a picture and then uploaded it to Photo Pea. After that, I copied my background layer and locked and hidden it. I used the backdrop remover tool to remove my background. I used multiple other tools to get the colors I have. Then I duplicate the layers multiple and put it in 4 different sides and get what I have.</p>
	<br>
<h2>Artifact #4</h2>
	
<img src="Artifacts/Photo 4.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""/>
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>This wasn't one of my favorites. I mention this because I initially didn't understand it. To draw the image I wanted, I had to just sit there and utilize Pixals. I chose a challenging image because I think I understood it. The worst error. But, while I loved the final product overall, it could have been better. I like it most because of the colors I used and how I made it.</p>
	<br>
<h2>Artifact #5</h2>
	
<img src="Artifacts/Photo 5.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""/>
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>I produced this project by taking a post it note and cutting along the edges, resulting in a strange looking design. After I've created that shape, I go to Adobe Illustrator and repeat the process. Instead, I used the pen tool, which I learnt in class. My artwork initially resembled a man with a sharp chin, but as I added color to it, it became even more bizarre. Dark purple and dark blue were my colors of choice. I chose these colors because I believe that mixing them in a project creates something truly distinctive and lovely. I'm fascinated with dark hues.</p>
	
	<br>
	
<h2>Artifact #6</h2>
	
<img src="Artifacts/Photo 6.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""/>
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>This task makes me discover my inner self. It reveals the actual character of who I am. I utilized symbols to represent who I am and images to convey who I am. One of my favorite projects is this one. I was free to define myself anyway I pleased. how I saw myself, not how I saw anyone else.</p>
	<br>
<h2>Artifact #7</h2>
	
	
<img src="Artifacts/Photo 7.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""/>
	
	
	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>1. Take a reference photo of yourself to use as a guide. We'll be tracing the contours of our faces from the outside in. (For this assignment I used a picture of myself that I took on photobooth) 2. Open your photo in Photoshop (Right-click the image you want to open > Open With > Adobe Photoshop).  3. Create a new layer once your photo is open. 4. Outline the primary shapes of your face using the three different pen tools: Pen Tool, Freeform Pen Tool, and Curvature Pen Tool. (I used the freeform Pen Tool. This was much easier to use then the rest. It helped me so much during this project  5. After you've completed your outline, utilize the Direct Selection Tool to alter and change any anchors in your portrait to make it more realistic and exact. To check on your progress, use the eyeball in your layers to hide your backdrop reference photo. (After doing all of these steps, I used the text box. I used this to write my name all over the background. All I did was pick a color I liked and used another color to blind in with it.)</p>
