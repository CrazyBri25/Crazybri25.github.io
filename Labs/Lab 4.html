<h1>Recipe for Chocolate Brownies </h1> 
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul><strong>
    <li>Chocolate chips</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>6 ounces (at least 72% cacao) dark chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>   
  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Vermont Creamery Sea Salt Cultured Butter - 82% Butterfat</li>
    <li>1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  </ul></strong>
<br>
  <h2>Steps To Make:</h2>
  <ol><em>
    <li>Heat oven to 350Â°F. Line 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, extending foil over edges. Set aside.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Whisk together flour and baking powder in small bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <br>
    
    <li>Place butter and chocolate in large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until chocolate is melted. Stir in espresso powder, vanilla, sugar, brown sugar, and salt until well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and then beating at high speed for one additional minute. Gently stir in flour mixture just until combined.</li>
   <br>
    
    <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Then take a few chocolate chips and sprinkle it around. Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Cool 20 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    
    <li>Refrigerate until serving. Lift brownies out of pan, using foil ends. Cut into 16 squares.</li>
