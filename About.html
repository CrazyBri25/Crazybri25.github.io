		<p>My favorite color is red and I like keeping myself busy. After BECA I would want to go to Havard or Oxford University. I want to study law and become a criminal defense attorney. I then want to pursue the career of being a judge and after that a judge in the supreme court. Lastly after all those steps I want to be President of the United States. </p>

<p>I would love to move out the Bronx and leave the country. I would love to go and live in Paris,France. I've always wanted to go there as a little girl. Since my favorite movie Ratatouille is based there, i've made it my mission to go explore or at least live there for a certain about of time.</p>
